# Machine Learning Flappy Bird

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Flappy Bird through trial and error in a simulated environment. The agentâ€™s performance improves over time as it optimizes its actions based on game feedback.

## Technologies
- **Python** for overall project logic and implementation
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for the ML model (choose your framework)
- **Pygame** for game simulation and visualization
